NDVI-based wildfire risk analysis using Sentinel-2 imagery, OSM powerlines, and geospatial ML 

A lightweight geospatial machine learning project inspired by Overstory's mission: analyzing tree health and proximity to infrastructure to help mitigate wildfire risk. This pipeline uses OSM powerlines, and geospatial ML, and Sentinel-2 imagery to compute NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) over Paradise, California â€” a region critically impacted by the 2018 Camp Fire.

---

## Project Goals
- Use real satellite data to compute and map tree health (via NDVI)
- Identify zones of high vegetation density near infrastructure
- Visualize overlaps with wildfire perimeters to assess risk
